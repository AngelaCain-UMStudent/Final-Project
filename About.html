          <p style = 'border:bisque; border-width:5px; border-style:solid;'>
            My main motivation for continuing my education and representing students as an RA 
            is the desire to represent something I never had throughout my childhood and college career.
            I am a queer, gender non-conforming, and BIPOC individual who has suffered mentally, financially, and spiritually due to
            the discrimination and lack of representation in STEM fields, and I'd like to break that cycle for future generations to come.</p>
